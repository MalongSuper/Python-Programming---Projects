# üí∏ SPEND WITHIN REASON  

**SPEND WITHIN REASON** is a strategy and critical-thinking game about money management.  
Players must balance **income, expenses, and random events** while aiming to keep their balance positive and maximize what they carry into the next level.  

---

## üéØ Objective
- Keep your **balance ‚â• 0** at all times.  
- End each level with the **highest possible balance**, since it carries over to the next.  
- Survive as many levels as possible, or end your run with the **Surrender** option once unlocked.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Rules

### 1. Spending & Earning
- **Expenses**:  
  - Regular costs (school fees, house maintenance, personal needs).  
  - Unexpected costs (fines, robbery, random events).  

- **Income**:  
  - Part-time jobs.  
  - Voluntary work (with rewards).  
  - Competitions and contests.  
  - Other money-earning opportunities.  

### 2. Levels & Progression
- Each level has new **financial challenges** and **income opportunities**.  
- If the balance drops **below 0**, the level is **failed**.  
- Players may retry the level, but the balance remains as-is (choices have lasting consequences).  

### 3. Choices & Consequences
- Players must decide what to prioritize‚Äî**not all expenses can be covered at once**.  
- Spending affects future opportunities.  
- Random events introduce unpredictability.  

### 4. Ending the Run
- After a certain level, players unlock **Surrender**.  
- Surrender secures your current balance as your **final score**.  

### 5. Victory & Loss
- **Loss**: Balance < 0 at any point.  
- **Continuing**: Keep balance ‚â• 0 and move on.  
- **Scoring**: The higher the balance at the end of the run, the better.
